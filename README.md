# Aleut.css

*– A fork of inuit.css*

[Inuit.css](https://github.com/inuitcss) introduced a [block-element-modifier (BEM)](https://en.bem.info/) and object-oriented framework for CSS. We love the work [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/) and his collaborators has done with Inuit. Acknowledging their work, we want to take it a step further and introduce it to the front-end community. Aleut adopts the ITCSS architecture and should be fully compatible with Inuit.css objects and components.
