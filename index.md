## What is Aleut CSS?
Aleut is a fork of [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss). It is a powerful framework designed with scalability and performance in mind. Inuit was left alone a little too long, so we made a more opinionated version with a lot of the ideas proposed by Harry Roberts, easier variable-names and fewer choices. If you are used to inuitcss, aleutcss should be more or less plug and play. If you wonder what this is and how you can use it, please read on.
