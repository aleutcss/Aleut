## What is Aleut CSS?
Aleutcss is a powerful framework designed with scalability and performance in mind. It doesnâ€™t make assumptions about what you want your design to look like. You can use as much or as little of the framework as you want and we try not to generate more lines of code than absolutely necessary.

We truly believe that aleutcss is the best starting point for any project, large or small, if you want full control over every part of your design.

The framework is a fork of [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss), written with SCSS, is object-oriented, based on BEM and built with the [itcss](http://itcss.io/) architecture.
